HW12 Report

My fuse filesystem is fairly simple and operates very much along
the guidelines of what was given to us. It implements the page
system managing individual directories by implementing the
directory.h file given to us in hints.

Due to time constraints and an unfortunately long amount of time
trying to implement certain key features incorrectly, my filesystem
is only capable of doing the bare minimum. It can create files,
list the files in the filesystem root directory, write to small
files, read from small files, and delete files. Due to some
misfortune however it is unable to rename files and I do not have
time to debug what's going on with this basic task. 

If I had more time I would have been able to add a lot more
functionality since just getting the base requirements for the
filesystem running took an absurd amount of time, while actually
implementing the features I do have took far less. I would also
definitely add some more utility functions for things that I did
quite often (like getting the last element of an slist) and try
to reduce redundancies throughout my code. 

Overall though, I'm glad my filesystem still works and does what
I expect it to do in the files that I've tested for.
